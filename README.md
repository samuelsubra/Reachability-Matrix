# Reachability-Matrix

A program that reads and analyzes reachability matrices for graphs. The program reads the reachability matrix data from user input, then analyzes the matrix and outputs a summary of its conclusions. The summary includes: the in-degrees and out-degrees for every node, the total number of self-loops in the graph, and the total numbers of paths and cycles of various lengths.
